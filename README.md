## Introduction

Welcome! In this repository, you can find the first lecture's slides, as well as a short description of possible themes below. 

## Themes

There are many interesting questions within the political connections literature. There seems, however, to be a pattern in the questions researchers are tackling. 
Some of those questions seem appropriate for an audience of students aiming to write a BSc thesis, and can be found below:

| Kind of study | Example: |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Event studies | Effect of state visits on stock prices |
| Cross-country studies | Effect of relations between big business and politicians on economic growth |
| Firm-level studies | Effect of a (former) politician on the Board of Directors on firm performance |

## Event studies

Event studies 

A seminal study about the theory and practice underlying event studies is provided here:

MacKinlay, A. C. (1997). Event studies in economics and finance. _Journal of economic literature_, 35(1), 13-39.

## Cross-country studies

Cross-country studies compare countries, or countries over time, and (usually) want to say something about their economic or societal development. 
In this theme, it could be relevant to think about how the relationships between big business and politics affect policy making, and maybe ultimately, economic growth of an entire country.

A few example questions to get your thinking started: 
- Usually, countries with a higher corruption index are associated with their politics being captured by powerful business interests. Why is this so? 
- Are there also reasons why intimate connections between politics and business could be beneficial? 
- Are there more ways that businesses' links with politics could impact a country, rather than only influencing economic growth?
- Could it be that politicians influence firms' behavior, rather than firms influencing politicians' behavior? What aggregate (macroeconomic) effects would that have?
- What could be the consequences of variation in regulation of politicians? Think about salary, or mandatory asset declarations of politicians, or behavior of state-owned companies?
- Could a country's institutions and regulation of politicians affect who becomes politically active?

## Firm-level studies
